						<h3>TRAA Trout Hatchery</h3>
						<h4>Rainbow Trout Eggs have Arrived!</h4>
					</div>
					<p>This year's allotment of rainbow trout eggs were delivered to the trout hatchery April 16th. 
This means we now have both rainbows and browns in the hatchery together! It's a great time to visit as you can see the trout both in the egg and the fry stage.<br><br>

The TRAA trout hatchery is a popular activity of the TRAA as it's a great teaching tool with regard to the life cycle of a trout. Those involved with the hatchery get to see firsthand the development stages of the egg and the fry before their final release destinations to area streams.<br><br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k-5p59CGWQ">Click Here</a> to see a video of the rainbow trout eggs being brought to the hatchery as well as a close look at the brown trout fry!<br><br>

You can <a href="#">Contact Us</a> or attend a TRAA General Meeting (see below) for more info.</p>

						<h3>TRAA Gear is now available!</h3>
						<h4>Tee shirts, hats and stickers.</h4>
					</div>

					<p>Many of you have already ordered the TRAA tee shirts, but if you haven't you had better hurry because many sizes are almost sold out! These are a steal at $15 each.<br><br>

					There are three different hat colours available: Clay Grey, Burnt Orange and Taupe. If you thought the tee's were a good deal, all three editions of these hats are also priced at $15 each.<br><br>

					We now have some nice stickers featuring the TRAA logo that you can display on your vehicle, boat, lunchbox or wherever you like. These are $2 each but you get one for joining the TRAA as a member or renewing an existing TRAA membership.<br><br>

Get your TRAA Gear (makes a great Christmas gift!) at any TRAA event, such as this coming General Meeting.</p>

			<h2>Local Businesses Step Up to Help Out the TRAA</h2>
			<h3>The support of the following area business people is much appreciated</h3>
			<div id="companies">
					<div id="compCon">
						<img id ="comp" src="images/melchers.png" alt="Melchers">
						<p id="thanks">Over the past couple of years the folks at Melchers Construction Ltd have offered up their beautiful boardroom for TRAA executive meetings. It's an ideal space with all the amenities required for us to accomplish all the "behind the scenes" work of the TRAA. Many thanks go out to the continued support of Melchers Construction Ltd.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="compCon">
						<img id ="comp" src="images/guillevin.gif" alt="Guillevin">
						<p id="thanks">Members of the trout hatchery rotation know the woes we've had with lighting in the hatchery. Even with larger fixtures installed a few years ago, it was still frustrating on days when the mercury dipped below -15C and the fluorescent technology just teased us with its dull flicker. Enter Mike Jeffries of <a href="https://www.guillevin.com/">Guillevin Greentech</a> in London with nice set of bright and dependable (and new!) LED fixtures. Once they were installed it was like working in well-appointed laboratory.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="compCon">
						<img id ="comp" src="images/muma.png" alt="Muma">
						<p id="thanks">The TRAA voted unanimously to re-name the TRAA trout hatchery honouring Keith Wales' memory and his unselfish support of the TRAA's work in the London area, in particular Komoka Creek. Special thanks go out to  <a href="http://www.mumamanufacturing.com/">Muma Manufacturing</a> in St. Thomas for donating the beautiful laser-cut aluminum sign.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="compCon">
						<img id ="comp" src="images/try.jpg" alt="Try Recycling">
						<p id="thanks">After cleaning up the area around the TRAA shed and trout hatchery, our trailer was quite full and needed to be emptied. A big 'thank you' goes out to Rick Vandersluis and Mike Seabrook of <a href="http://tryrecycling.com/">Try Recycling</a> who allowed the TRAA to empty the trailer at their facility free of charge.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="compCon">
						<img id ="comp" src="images/anglings.png" alt="Angling">
						<p id="thanks">Before we could take the trailer to Try Recycling, we needed to get the spare tire for the trailer fixed. Pat Devincenzo, proprietor of <a href="https://anglingsports.ca/">Angling Sports</a>, offered to get it repaired. Turns out the tire needed replacing and Pat took care of it.
						Angling Sports also supplied cards for all TRAA members that entitle them to a discount equal to the tax on anything in the store.
						Thanks Pat, your generosity is greatly appreciated.</p>
